I am a PhD student at the University of California at Santa Cruz, focused on field robotics for advanced sensing in agroecology.
My co-advisors are Dr. Steve McGuire (field robotics) and Dr. Colleen Josephson (advanced sensing).
My role is to implement robotics systems to persistently monitor arrays of Dr. Josephson's ultra-low power sensing modalities and the environments they are embedded in.
Concurrently, I work at at the Applied Physics Laboratory of the University of Washington,
developing physics-informed, deep-learning-based visual tracking solutions for applications in marine robotics.

I am broadly interested in the mathematical design and development of traversal strategies for field robotics systems to collect the most informative dataset, given mission constraints.
Some specific topics I am interested in are:
+ The traversal of a geotagged environment to collect user-curated imagery of a flight, to create supervised learning datasets for robotic vision models,
+ Compressive sensing schemes for subsampling overly-large arrays of environmental sensors for accurate state estimation.
+ The traversal of environments in order to compile the best set of views to train novel view synthesis methods.
All of these share roots in combinatorial optimization problems like the traveling salesman and next-best view planning problem.

My M.S. in Applied Mathematics was earned in 2019 at the University of Washington, advised by Dr. J. Nathan Kutz.
I also earned two B.S. degrees in: (i.) Physics and Mathematics and (ii.) Materials Science & Engineering in 2018 from Iowa State University, advised by Dr. Paul C. Canfield.
