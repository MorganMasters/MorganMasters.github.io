The PHYS 114-115-116 introductory physics sequence is targeted for students in life sciences. Upon successful completion students should be able to develop algebra-based models to describe the physical world and apply them to other fields of science and everyday phenomena. Each course consists of two major components: lecture and tutorial. There is no lab component in these courses. But there are associated lab courses, PHYS 117-118-119.

PHYS 114
======
Covers: Scaling; 1D and 2D kinematics; Forces; Circular and rotational motion; Rotational dynamics; Static equilibrium; Momentum; Work and energy

I taught both lab (PHYS 117) and tutorial sections.


PHYS 115
======
Covers: Electric force, field, potential, and potential energy; Electric circuits; Magnetic field and force; Thermodynamics; Ideal gas law; Fluids

I taught tutorial sections.


PHYS 116
======
Covers: Oscillations; Mechanical waves; Physical optics; Geometric optics; Electromagnetic waves; Matter waves; Atomic physics; Nuclear physics
