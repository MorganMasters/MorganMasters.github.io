Computer Systems and C Programming is a class intended to bring students up to speed on programming small and large programs in C.
Originally written in 1978, C remains the most  popular programming language, and the most used one in terms of numbers of computer programs written in it.
In this class, we approached C from an embedded paradigm, and all programming assignments are on a 32-bit embedded micro; either the Microchip PIC32 or the STM32.
Students learn how to program in C, how to write modular code, and some of the tips and tricks when dealing with an embedded micro.
